                    "question": "How often should I update my forecasts?",
                    "answer": "Forecasting is not a one-time activity; it's a continuous process. We recommend updating your forecasts at least on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if your business is rapidly changing or if you operate in a volatile industry. Regular updates ensure that your forecasts reflect the most current information and help you stay proactive in your decision-making."

                    "question": "What happens if my actuals are different from my forecasts?",
                    "answer": "It's quite normal for there to be discrepancies between forecasted figures and actual results, as forecasts are, by nature, estimations based on the best available data at the time. When your actuals differ from your forecasts, it's important to analyze the reasons behind these variances. This analysis can provide valuable insights into market conditions, operational challenges, or areas where your business model may need adjustment. Use these differences as a learning tool to continuously improve your forecasting methods and business strategy. Our platform also offers features to help you adjust your forecasts in real time, ensuring they remain as accurate and useful as possible."
